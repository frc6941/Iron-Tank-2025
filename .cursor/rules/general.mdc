When debugging, only make code changes if you are certain that you can solve the problem.
Otherwise, follow debugging best practices:
1. Address the root cause instead of the symptoms.
2. Add descriptive logging statements and error messages to track variable and code state.
3. Add test functions and statements to isolate the problem.
